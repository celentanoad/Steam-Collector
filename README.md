# Steam Collector
Steam Collector is a simple website to keep track of your Steam games.  It  can be overwhelming to look at your Steam library and have so many choices of games to play.  Steam Collector makes it easy to see the games you have not played yet when you want to try something new, or which games you currently playing or already completed.

## User Experience

### User Story #1
##### Lenny lost his job as a bartender when all the bars and restaurants closed down, and when he isn't practicing making drinks at home, he wants to spend his free time playing video games.  Lenny doesn't want to spend his savings buying new games and instead looks to the hundreds of games in his Steam library. Lenny needs an easy way to organize his games so he can quickly keep track of which games he has yet to play.

### User Story #2
##### Carl is a completionist and loves to spend hours finishing every side quest, finding every collection item, and earning every acheivement in the games he plays.  He has lots of games in his Steam library, and it is tedious for him to go through each game to see whether he has completed them.  Carl wants to categorize his games to keep track of which games he's completed, and which ones still need some work.



## Next Steps
- View other users' game lists
- Search by game title
- Implement Steam API
- Filter games based on rating or type
- Archive games from lists instead of deleting them permanently
